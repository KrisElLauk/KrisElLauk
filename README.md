I am a Software Developer currently specializing in Java.

My journey as a Software Developer began early 2022. After working as a Woodworking Operator for 4 years, I decided to take on my biggest step yet, to become a Software Developer. I have always been fascinated by continuous development in this field, which was the main reason I decided to take on this challenge, and I am really liking it.

Always looking to improve on my skills and personal growth.
